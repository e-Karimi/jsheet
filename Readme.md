## üß≤ Features

- Click any text cells to edit it

- The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell#1, you can refer it to any following cells!

- You can show any React component, string, number or anything else by calling <mark style="background-color: lightblue;color:black;padding:0px 8px 3px ; border-radius:5px"> show function</mark> . This is a function built into this environment.
  Call multiple times to show multiple values.

```bash
 show(<h1>Hi thre<h1>)     show(2)  show('string')
```

- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right

- Add new cells by clicking on the add cell and text buttons
